# Kiteblaze

Kiteblaze simplifies launching applications on cloud. We automate cloud deployment through our systems which automatically configures environments & containers, handles package managers, maintain stack, configure DB & handle data migration, run test-cases etc. With Kiteblaze it is as simple as linking your Github repo, configure DB and make your application Live.

## Why

Building great application is a craft. And great engineers & developers need to be focussed on things that they are good at - building apps and not deal with cloud deployment & manage containers.
